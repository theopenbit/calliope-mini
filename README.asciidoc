count the touches of P0. The value is displayed as binary number on the led matrix
* compass +
an arrow on the led matrix ponits in direction of north 
* falling block +
a game unsing the led matrix. You have to capture falling blocks
* rolling ball +
move the led on the matrix by tilting the calliope
